Looking back at the SQL stuff I did, it was mostly about making tables and asking questions from them. But even with simple stuff like that, it's important to think about doing it right.

Doing Things the Right Way:
When I ask questions from a database, I need to make sure I'm not asking for stuff I shouldn’t see, like personal info. I’d only ask for what I really need, to keep people’s info private. It's like if I’m looking for someone's name, I shouldn’t also ask for their address if I don't need it.

Including Everyone:
I also need to think about who the info in the database represents. If it’s only about one group of people, it might not be fair. It's like if I only ask questions about people from one town, I’m leaving out everyone else. I need to make sure I'm looking at info that represents lots of different people.

Practical Adjustments:
To make things better, I’d start by double-checking the info I use and only asking for what's needed. Then, I’d make sure I'm looking at info that represents lots of different people, not just one group. This way, my work would be fair and respectful to everyone.
